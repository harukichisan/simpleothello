# Operating System (Non-negotiables)

Single source of truth:
- @docs/spec.md
- @docs/security.md
- @docs/project-config.md
- @schemas/
- @api/openapi.yaml (if present)

Before making changes, you MUST:
1) Propose a plan
2) List files to change
3) Specify exact validation commands (from docs/project-config.md)

Constraints:
- Keep each iteration small (<= 5 files touched).
- Do not add new libraries unless explicitly requested.
- If behavior changes: update spec/schema/contract FIRST, then tests, then implementation.

Completion:
- Never claim "done" without listing the commands to run and expected results.
